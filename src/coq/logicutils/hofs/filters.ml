(*
 * Eliminate inductive hypotheses if possible.
 * This takes in a list of reduced candidates and filters out
 * the ones that still reference the IH.
 *
 * For now, only deals with candidates that refer explicitly to IH.
 * The ones that do will not pass the filter,
 * while the ones that don't will, and will then be type-checked.
 *
 * Sometimes this will not be possible, in which case we need a backup plan.
 * This is not yet implemented.
